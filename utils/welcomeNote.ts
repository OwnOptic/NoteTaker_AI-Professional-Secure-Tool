export const WELCOME_NOTE_CONTENT = `Welcome to your new intelligent notepad! This is a sample note to demonstrate the core features.

## What is this?
This application is designed to be your **second brain**. It's a private, offline-first workspace where you can capture thoughts, meeting notes, and project plans. What makes it special is the built-in AI assistant, **Cognito**.

## Key Features to Try

- **Automatic AI Sync:** After you finish writing this note (or any note), Cognito works in the background to analyze the content. Look for the pulsing app logo in the top-left to see when the AI is working! It will automatically generate a summary, a to-do list, and identify key people and tags on the right-hand panel.

- **AI Quick Actions:** Use the "Actions" menu above to unlock more AI power. You can translate this note, change its tone to be more professional, and more.

- **Chat with your notes:** Click the chat bubble in the bottom right to talk to Cognito. Ask it "What are the main features of this app?" and see what it says!

We hope you enjoy building your second brain!`;
