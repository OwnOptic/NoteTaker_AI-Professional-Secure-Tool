### Core Functionality

## üöÄ Future Features & Backlog

### High Priority
- **End-to-End Encrypted Cloud Sync (Optional):** Allow users to optionally sync their encrypted data across devices using a cloud provider like Google Drive or Dropbox. The encryption key would remain client-side to preserve the privacy-first model.
- **Advanced Search Operators:** Introduce search operators like `tag:`, `project:`, `created:<date>`, and boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) for more precise filtering.
- **Mobile App Wrapper (Capacitor/Tauri):** Package the web app as a native mobile application for better performance and deeper platform integration (e.g., share sheets, notifications).

### Medium Priority
- **Note Sharing:** Generate secure, time-limited, read-only links for individual notes.
- **Calendar Integration:** Create a new view to see notes on a calendar based on their creation date or a specified date in the note's metadata.
- **Expanded Visualizations:** Enhance the `DataGraph` component to support more chart types (line, pie) and allow users to manually create charts from tables in their notes.
- **Plugin System:** Develop an architecture to allow for third-party plugins (e.g., a "publish to blog" plugin, a Zotero integration plugin for researchers).

### Ideas & Enhancements
- **Voice Memos:** Allow users to record and attach audio clips to notes, with on-demand AI transcription.
- **Web Clipper Extension:** A browser extension to easily clip articles and web content directly into NoteTaker AI as a new note.
- **Real-time Collaboration:** A significant feature that would require a backend (e.g., using CRDTs), potentially as an opt-in "pro" feature for teams.
- **Customizable Dashboards:** Allow users to add, remove, and rearrange widgets on their dashboard view.
