# NoteTaker AI: Comprehensive Technical Documentation for Content Generation

This document provides a comprehensive technical breakdown of the NoteTaker AI application. It is intended for use by AI models to generate accurate and compelling marketing copy, blog posts, feature announcements, and other content, as well as to answer technical user questions.

## 1. High-Level Concept

**Core Identity:** NoteTaker AI is a **privacy-first, offline-capable, intelligent note-taking application** that acts as a user's "second brain." It transforms unstructured information into organized, accessible knowledge.

**Core Value Proposition:**
1.  **Absolute Privacy & Ownership:** All user data (notes, projects, settings) is stored exclusively in the browser's **IndexedDB**. There is no backend server, and no user data is ever stored in the cloud by the application itself. The user owns their data completely.
2.  **Uninterrupted Offline Access:** The application is fully functional without an internet connection. Notes can be created, edited, and organized offline. This is a core design principle, not an afterthought, enabled by IndexedDB and a robust Service Worker caching strategy.
3.  **Autonomous AI Organization:** The app leverages the Google Gemini API to supercharge note-taking. It doesn't just store text; it understands, organizes, and enriches it, turning raw input into structured knowledge automatically and in the background.

**Ideal User Persona:** The privacy-conscious professional, student, researcher, or creative who deals with a high volume of unstructured information (meeting notes, research articles, brainstorming sessions, project plans) and desires a tool that actively helps in sense-making without compromising data ownership.

**Key Technologies:**
*   **Frontend:** React, TypeScript
*   **AI:** Google Gemini API (`@google/genai`)
*   **Data Storage:** IndexedDB (via `idb` library)
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (with a custom theme)
*   **Offline Capability:** Service Workers API
*   **Client-Side File Parsing:** `mammoth` (DOCX), `pdfjs-dist` (PDF), `read-excel-file` (XLSX)

## 2. Application Architecture

### 2.1. Client-Side Foundation
The application is a pure Single-Page Application (SPA). All logic, rendering, and data management happen in the user's browser. There is **no proprietary backend server**.

### 2.2. Data Storage (`services/dbService.ts`)
This is the bedrock of the application's privacy model.
*   **Mechanism:** Uses the browser's IndexedDB, a persistent, client-side database.
*   **Wrapper:** The `idb` library provides a clean, promise-based API for easier interaction. All database logic is centralized in `dbService.ts`.
*   **Stores (Tables):**
    *   `notes`: Stores individual `Note` objects.
    *   `projects`: Stores the `Project` hierarchy. A `Project` contains an array of `Subject`s.
    *   `userSettings`: A key-value store for a single `UserSettings` object, which includes the theme, language preferences, and the crucial **user-provided Gemini API key**.
    *   `noteVersions`: Stores historical snapshots of notes every time they are significantly changed, enabling a version history feature.

### 2.3. State Management (`App.tsx`)
*   **Central Component:** `App.tsx` is the root component, managing the application's global state using React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`).
*   **Data Flow:** State is passed down to child components via props. Callbacks are passed down for children to request state changes (e.g., `handleNoteUpdate`, `handleDeleteNote`). This follows standard React patterns for state management in a moderately complex application.

### 2.4. AI Service Layer (`services/geminiService.ts`)
This file is the sole gateway to the Google Gemini API.
*   **Authentication:** It retrieves the user's API key from the `UserSettings` object. **Critically, AI features are non-functional without this key.**
*   **Task Router (`processAiTask`):** This central function is a key piece of architecture. It receives a specific `AiTask` object (e.g., `{ type: 'FULL_ANALYSIS', note: ... }`) and constructs the appropriate prompt, model configuration, and JSON schema for the Gemini API call.
*   **Structured Output:** For most organizational tasks, it uses Gemini's JSON mode by providing a `responseSchema`. This ensures the AI returns predictable, structured data (`OrganizedNote`, `OrganizedContentData`) that the app can directly use to update its state and database, avoiding brittle text parsing.

### 2.5. UI/UX Philosophy
*   **Clarity & Focus:** The UI is designed to be clean and minimalist, reducing cognitive load. The main view is a two-panel layout: editor on the left, AI insights on the right.
*   **Responsive Design:** The app works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices.
*   **Keyboard-First Navigation:** Features like the Command Palette (Ctrl+K) are central to the experience, allowing power users to navigate and perform actions without leaving the keyboard.
*   **Thematic:** A polished dark mode is the default, with a clean light mode available in settings. The color palette is consistent, using an accent color to draw attention to primary actions and AI-related features.
*   **Informative Feedback:** The app provides clear, non-intrusive feedback for background processes like saving (`Saving...`) and AI processing (`Syncing with AI...`, pulsing logo).

### 2.6. Offline & Caching Strategy (`service-worker.js`)
*   **Technology:** A Service Worker script provides robust offline capabilities.
*   **Strategy:** The service worker uses a **"Network falling back to Cache"** strategy.
    1.  It first attempts to fetch a resource from the network. This ensures users always get the latest version if they are online.
    2.  If the network request succeeds, the response is cached for future offline use.
    3.  If the network request fails (e.g., user is offline), the service worker attempts to serve the resource from the cache.
*   **Scope:** This caches the application shell, core scripts, and assets, making the app load and function even without an internet connection.

### 2.7. Internationalization (i18n) (`hooks/useLocalization.ts`)
*   **Framework:** The app uses a custom React Context-based provider (`LocalizationProvider`) for i18n.
*   **Implementation:** Language files (`en.json`, `fr.json`, etc.) are stored in the `public/locales` directory. The `useLocalization` hook provides the `t` function for translating strings throughout the component tree.
*   **User Control:** Users can select their preferred UI language in the Settings modal, which updates the context and re-renders the app with the new language.

## 3. Core Feature Breakdown & Technical Details

### 3.1. Onboarding and First Run
*   **Flow:** A new user is greeted by `OnboardingModal.tsx`.
*   **Requirement:** The user **must** enter a valid Gemini API key to proceed. This is the primary gate for enabling AI features.
*   **Technical Implementation:** On completion, `initializeNewUser` in `App.tsx` populates IndexedDB with a welcome note and several pre-built templates from `utils/templateNotes.ts` to showcase functionality. It also creates the initial 'Getting Started' project.

### 3.2. The AI Auto-Sync Loop (Key Differentiator)
*   **Trigger:** After a user edits a note's title or content, the `handleNoteUpdate` function calls `saveNoteChanges`, which itself is wrapped in a `debounce` function from `utils/debounce.ts`. This prevents excessive API calls while the user is actively typing.
*   **Technical Implementation:** The debounced function (`debouncedAiSync`) triggers the `FULL_ANALYSIS` task in `geminiService.ts`. The AI returns a JSON object based on the `organizationSchema`. `App.tsx` then updates the note in state and IndexedDB. The UI re-renders to display the new, AI-generated insights.
*   **User Experience:** This feels seamless and automatic. The pulsing logo in the header is the only indicator of this background activity.

### 3.3. Meeting Assistant (`MeetingModeModal.tsx`)
*   **Functionality:** A dedicated modal for capturing live meetings.
*   **Technical Implementation:**
    *   **Microphone:** Uses the **Web Speech API** via the `useSpeechRecognition` hook for real-time transcription.
    *   **System Audio:** Leverages the **`getDisplayMedia` API** (screen sharing). If the user shares a tab with audio, the resulting `MediaStream` is captured. A `MediaRecorder` instance records this stream into a blob.
    *   **Visual Context:** A `setInterval` captures frames from the shared screen's `<video>` element onto a `<canvas>` and converts them to JPEG data URLs.
    *   **AI Processing:** For system audio, the recorded audio blob is base64-encoded and sent to Gemini with the `TRANSCRIBE_AUDIO` task, along with the screenshots. For microphone input, the final transcript string is sent with the `MEETING_ANALYSIS` task.

### 3.4. Content Upload & Analysis (`UploadModal.tsx`)
*   **Functionality:** Users can upload files (`.txt`, `.md`, `.docx`, `.pdf`, images, `.xlsx`).
*   **Technical Implementation:**
    *   **Client-Side Parsing:** Content is extracted *in the browser*. `mammoth.js` handles `.docx`, `pdfjs-dist` extracts text from `.pdf`, `read-excel-file` converts spreadsheets to markdown tables, and the `FileReader` API handles text and images.
    *   **AI Processing:** The extracted text (or the base64 data of an image) is sent to Gemini with an `UPLOAD_ANALYSIS` task. For images and PDFs, the model performs OCR and analysis.
    *   **Result:** The AI returns a fully structured note object, including a generated title, which is then saved.

### 3.5. Cognito AI Chat (`Chatbot.tsx`)
*   **Functionality:** A chat interface where users can ask questions about their own notes.
*   **Technical Implementation:** When a user sends a message, `App.tsx`'s `handleSendMessage` function gathers the content of all non-archived notes, creates a concise XML-like context string (`<note id="..."><title>...</title>...</note>`), and includes it in the prompt for the `CHAT_QUERY` task. The prompt explicitly instructs the AI to use only this context and to cite `sourceNoteIds` in its JSON response. The UI then renders these IDs as clickable links.

### 3.6. Mind Map & Note Linking (`MindMapModal.tsx`)
*   **Functionality:** A visual representation of the connections between notes.
*   **Technical Implementation:**
    *   **Syntax:** Users create links using `[[Note Title]]` wiki-style syntax.
    *   **Editor Rendering:** `NoteEditor.tsx` uses a regex to find these links. It then searches the `allNotes` array to see if a note with a matching title exists and renders a clickable `<a>` tag with a `data-note-link` attribute.
    *   **Mind Map Generation:** The `MindMapModal` performs the same regex matching to build an array of `MindMapEdge` objects. It uses a simple clustering algorithm in `calculateLayout` to initially position nodes based on their project, then renders them as SVG elements. Nodes can be dragged and dropped.

### 3.7. Command Palette (`CommandPalette.tsx`)
*   **Functionality:** A quick-action menu (invoked with `Ctrl+K` or `Cmd+K`) for fast navigation and commands.
*   **Technical Implementation:** It's a single component that receives notes, projects, and actions as props. A `useMemo` hook compiles a flat list of all possible commands (e.g., "New Note", "Go to Project X", "Go to Note Y"). A search input filters this list in real-time. Keyboard events are used to navigate (`ArrowUp`/`ArrowDown`) and execute (`Enter`) commands.

### 3.8. Version History (`VersionHistoryModal.tsx`)
*   **Functionality:** Allows users to view and restore previous versions of a note.
*   **Technical Implementation:** The `saveNoteChanges` function in `App.tsx` is debounced. Before it saves an update to the main `notes` store, it fetches the *original* note from IndexedDB. If the content or title has changed, it creates a new `NoteVersion` object and saves it to the `noteVersions` store in `dbService.ts`. The modal then queries this store for all versions matching the active `noteId`.

## 4. Security & Privacy Model (Crucial for Marketing)

This is a cornerstone of the app's identity.

*   **No Central Server:** The application is a static site. There is no proprietary backend that could ever access or store user notes.
*   **API Key Security:** The user's Google Gemini API key is stored **only in their browser's IndexedDB**. It is never transmitted to any server except directly to Google's API endpoints (`generativelanguage.googleapis.com`) to authenticate the AI requests.
*   **Data in Transit:** Note content is sent from the user's browser directly to the Google Gemini API over HTTPS. It is not proxied through any third-party server.
*   **Data at Rest:** All data (notes, projects, API key) resides entirely on the user's local machine within the browser's sandboxed storage.
*   **Google's Data Use Policy:** Per the Google Gemini API terms of service, data sent to the API is not used for training models or any other purpose. This should be a key talking point.

### 5.4. Answering Technical User Questions (Example Q&A)

*   **Q: Where is my data stored? Is it secure?**
    *   **A:** Your data is stored securely in IndexedDB, a database that lives inside your own browser on your computer. It never leaves your machine to be stored on a server. This makes it completely private and accessible offline.

*   **Q: Does the developer or any third party see my notes?**
    *   **A:** Absolutely not. The application is designed so that your notes are never sent to our servers (we don't have any!). When you use AI features, your note content is sent directly from your browser to Google's Gemini API, and even they do not store it or use it for training, per their API policy.

*   **Q: Will it work if I don't have an internet connection?**
    *   **A:** Yes. You can create, read, edit, and organize all your notes while completely offline. AI features require an internet connection to work, but the core note-taking functionality is always available.

*   **Q: Why do I need to provide my own API key?**
    *   **A:** This is a core part of our privacy-first design. By using your own key, you are in a direct relationship with the AI provider (Google). It ensures we never act as a middleman, and you have full control and transparency over your API usage.
